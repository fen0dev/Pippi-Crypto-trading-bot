# Pippi
Pippi is a crypto trading bot realized entirely in Python. The project is not finished, it needs some minor changes and improvements especially in the "index.html" file.
I'm confident that the python code works perfectly.

# Bollinger band
The backend algorithm uses the bollinger band technical analysis which is a tool used to determine where prices are high and low relative to each other.These bands are composed of three lines: a simple moving average (the middle band) and an upper and lower band. The upper and lower bands are typically two standard deviations above or below a 20-period simple moving average (SMA). The bands widen and narrow as the volatility of the underlying asset changes.
